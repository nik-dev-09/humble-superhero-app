# Humble Superhero API

Welcome to the **Humble Superhero API** project! This API allows you to manage superheroes, their superpowers, and humility scores. Each superhero is unique in their own way, but it's their humility that makes them truly stand out.

## 🦸‍♂️ **Project Overview**

The **Humble Superhero API** allows users to:

-   **Add a new superhero** by providing their name, superpower, and a humility score (rating out of 10).
-   **Fetch a sorted list** of superheroes based on their humility score, ranked from most humble to least humble.

### 🛠 **Prerequisites**

-   **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
