# Humble Superhero APP

Welcome to the **Humble Superhero APP** project! This API allows you to manage superheroes, their superpowers, and humility scores. Each superhero is unique in their own way, but it's their humility that makes them truly stand out.

## 🦸‍♂️ **Project Overview**

The **Humble Superhero APP** allows users to:

-   **Add a new superhero** by providing their name, superpower, and a humility score (rating out of 10).
-   **Fetch a sorted list** of superheroes based on their humility score, ranked from most humble to least humble.

## 🌍 **How to Run the Project**

This project is structured as a monorepo and includes both backend and frontend components.

### 🛠 **Prerequisites**

-   **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
-   **Yarn** or **npm**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nik-dev-09/humble-superhero-app.git
    ```

### 🚀 **Frontend Setup**

The frontend is built using **ReactJS** and allows you to manage superheroes.

```bash
cd humble-superhero-api/frontend-app
```

### 🚀 **Backend Setup**

The backend is built using **NestJS** and stores superhero data in an in-memory database.

```bash
cd humble-superhero-api/backend-app
```

## 🧠 If I Had More Time

If I had more time, I would:

-   **Implement Persistent Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with a database PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data persistence.
